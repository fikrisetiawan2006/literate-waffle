# literate-waffle
literate-waffle is a simple task manager application built using the localStorage API. This app was made while I was learning JavaScript. I hope you like it. This repository is open for bug reports as improvements for the next update. You can open an application that is already hosted on netlify by visiting https://literate-waffle.netlify.app.
